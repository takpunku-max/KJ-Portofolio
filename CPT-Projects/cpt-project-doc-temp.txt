# Project Name (short + clear)
AWS EC2 Web Server with Nginx and Firewall Hardening

## When
[Month Year] – [Month Year] or “Ongoing”

## Goal
Short sentence: what were you trying to accomplish?

Example:
Deploy a secure, publicly accessible web server on AWS using an Ubuntu EC2 instance, Nginx, and a locked-down firewall.

## Tech Used
- AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)
- Nginx
- UFW firewall
- SSH (key-based auth)
- Linux (CLI)

## What I Did (bullet points, detailed)
- Launched an Ubuntu EC2 instance in AWS and configured security groups for SSH and HTTP.
- Installed and configured Nginx as a web server, verified it was reachable from the internet.
- Configured `ufw` to allow only SSH and HTTP/HTTPS traffic, blocking all other inbound ports.
- Set up SSH key-based authentication, disabled password logins, and tested access from my main machine.
- Reboot-tested the instance to make sure firewall, Nginx, and SSH settings persisted across restarts.

## Problems I Solved / Lessons Learned
- Example: Nginx not loading due to conflicting firewall rules; fixed by aligning security group + `ufw`.
- Example: SSH still prompting for password; resolved by updating `sshd_config` and restarting the service.
- Example: Learned difference between cloud security groups and OS-level firewall.

## Commands / Config Snippets (optional)
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw enable
...

Do the same for a **Cisco Packet Tracer** project:

- “Small Office Network with VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing”
- “Home Network Simulation with Wireless + DHCP + Default Gateway”
- Spell out: devices, addressing, VLANs, routing, troubleshooting.

This is the tedious part, but once it’s written, you never lose those details again.

## 2️⃣ Turn those projects into strong **resume bullets**

From each project file, you’ll pull **2–3 bullets** max that sound like job experience.

Example from your AWS EC2 project:

> - Deployed an Ubuntu-based EC2 instance on AWS and configured Nginx to host a public-facing web server.  
> - Hardened remote access by enforcing SSH key-based authentication, disabling password login, and restricting inbound traffic via AWS security groups and `ufw` firewall rules.  
> - Troubleshot and resolved connectivity issues caused by conflicting firewall and security group settings, ensuring consistent access after system reboots.

Example from a Cisco PT project:

> - Designed and implemented a simulated small office network in Cisco Packet Tracer with VLANs, DHCP, and inter-VLAN routing.  
> - Configured switchports, default gateways, and routing to allow devices on different VLANs to communicate securely.  
> - Tested connectivity and troubleshooting tools (ping, traceroute, IP addressing) to validate network design.

We’ll plug these into your resume in a projects section and/or under “Relevant Experience.”

## 3️⃣ Build a **simple online resume site** on your EC2

You already have:
- Ubuntu EC2  
- Nginx  
So you’re 80% there.

### Step 1: Find your web root

On Ubuntu with Nginx default config, it’s usually:

```bash
cd /var/www/html
ls
